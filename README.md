# time-my-train
Tells you which trains are crossing by and attempts to get real-time train schedule

## Motivation
I'm a huge Indian Railways' fan. I have always been intrigued by the motion and schedule of trains. I used to enjoy parallel crossing of trains and it was great when I saw two trains moving parallel in same direction. I wanted to create a CMD app that can find when this event would take place if I'm travelling in a train. This project sources all of its data from [IndianRailInfo] (https://indiarailinfo.com/) which is one of the largest community of RailFans in the world.

## Method
The project uses python. It checks between any 2 stations which trains might be travelling, compares their apparent speed and travel times to give the user an idea of possible parallel actions. It is currently in progress.
